# Ecdsa

This is Alchemy University Week 1 final project implemented using rust. It is a simple server that receives and processes transactions using cryptographic signatures.

It tries to mimic how ethereum transactions work by using the same cryptographic primitives.

## Future plans

Improve the project as I learn more rust concepts.
